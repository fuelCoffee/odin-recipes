    <h2>No Churn Vegan Chocolate Ice Cream</h2>
    <h4>
      5-ingredient no-churn vegan chocolate ice cream that has all the
      creaminess, flavor, <br />
      and richness of the real thing! Naturally sweetened, vegan, and
      gluten-free.
    </h4>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        2 14-ounce cans coconut cream OR full- fat coconut milk (chilled
        overnight in the fridge // I like Trader Joe’s coconut cream or Thai
        Kitchen coconut milk)
      </li>
      <li>2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa or cacao powder powder</li>
      <li>
        14-16 ounces pitted dates (if not sticky and moist, soak in warm water
        for 10 minutes then drain)
      </li>
      <li>1 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Place a large mixing bowl in the freezer to chill for 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        In the meantime, add moist, pitted dates to a food processor and process
        until small bits remain. Then add hot water a little at a time until it
        forms a thick paste. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Without tipping the cans, scoop out the coconut cream from the cans of
        coconut cream OR coconut milk, reserving the clear liquid for other
        uses. Place in chilled mixing bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>NOTE</strong>: If you’re using coconut milk, you’ll likely use
        less sweetener because there’s less volume.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a mixer, whip until creamy and smooth. Then add cocoa powder,
        vanilla, almond milk, and half of the date paste. Whip until fully
        incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste and adjust flavors as needed. I ended up adding most of the date
        paste and a little more cocoa powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer to a parchment-lined freezer-safe container and cover loosely
        with plastic wrap, then foil to help freeze.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can take this out in a couple of hours for a chilled mousse-like ice
        cream. Freeze overnight for a firmer ice cream.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set out for at least 20 minutes prior to scooping, and use a scoop
        warmed under hot water for a proper scoop.
      </li>
      <li>Will keep in the freezer for up to one week, but best when fresh.</li>
    </ol>
