        >
      </li>
      <li>2/3 cup water</li>
      <li>
        1/4 cup avocado oil (or other neutral-flavored oil such as refined
        coconut oil)
      </li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and lightly grease an 8-inch
        round cake pan with oil or line a standard-size muffin tin with paper
        liners. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        To a medium mixing bowl, add all the dry ingredients (almond flour,
        coconut sugar, potato starch, cocoa powder, tapioca starch, flaxseed
        meal, baking powder, baking soda, sea salt, and xanthan gum). Whisk well
        to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, add the water, oil, and vanilla extract. Whisk thoroughly until no
        flour streaks remain. Pour the batter into your prepared baking pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place in the preheated oven and bake for 28-32 minutes (for an 8-inch
        cake) or 18-20 minutes (for cupcakes), or until a toothpick inserted
        into the center comes out mostly clean (with only a few crumbs).
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes. To remove from the cake
        pan, run a dull knife around the edge of the pan to loosen the cake.
        Then place a plate or cooling rack on top and quickly invert. Allow to
        cool completely (~1 hour) before frosting and serving!
      </li>
      <li>
        This cake pairs well with our Vegan Chocolate Ganache Frosting, Coconut
        Whipped Cream, Fluffy Vegan Peanut Butter Frosting, Vegan Strawberry
        Frosting, or Chocolate Avocado Frosting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Store leftovers lightly covered at room temperature for up to 2-3 days*,
        in the refrigerator for 4-5 days, or in the freezer for 1 month. Cake
        can be baked ahead and frozen unfrosted. Let thaw completely at room
        temperature before serving.
